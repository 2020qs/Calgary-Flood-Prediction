# Calgary-Flood-Prediction
Calgary is a city locates in southern Alberta, Canada, and it is the third most populous municipality in Canada. As of 2021, its population reached 1,306,784, and its land area is about 820.63 square kilometers. The city is vulnerable to floods since it has extensive development along the Elbow River and Bow River. 
Moreover, the risk of flooding will continue to increase as climate change ongoing; the accelerated snowmelt in spring will add extraordinary pressure on the watercourse and city sewer system. As one of the largest cities in the country, Calgary has a relatively comprehensive flood monitoring approach and has collected a fair amount of data for floods. By using the given flood satellite image and the DEM, along with the landcover data our group collected, we fitted a generalized linear model to predict flood in Calgary. With the given flood inundation data, we were able to cross-validate the model we established and then applied it to Edmonton, a comparable city to Calgary, to predict inundation for the city.
